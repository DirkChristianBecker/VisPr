# VisPr Server
The server handles user management, creating and running processes, session management, scheduling etc. It is also the endpoint both client and runtime call first. The runtime to make itself known to the server. The client is effectively a UI for all Web-Services the server offers (and a UI for building processes visually).

# Examples
It is possible to build your client for the server. If this is your goal have a look at the file 'VisPr_Server--soapui-project.xml'. This file contains examples for all methods the server offers.
